## Disclaimer
This installer is unofficial, and is not endorsed, affiliated, or supported by Shaxpir in any way. The Shaxpir desktop application is proprietary software, and using it means you agree to its [Terms of Service](https://shaxpir.com/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://shaxpir.com/privacy-policy). This work is done on my own free time out of personal interest and is not related to my employer. 

## Features

## How to install
1. Open PlayOnLinux
2. Open the "Tools" menu, and choose "Run a local script"
3. Click, Next, then browse, and open pol_shaxpir.sh from where it was downloaded to. 
4. Click next and check "I agree" to confirm the warnings. This script is open-source, and can be reviewed for malware if you wish (open pol_shaxpir.sh in a text editor and have a look!).
5. Continue to follow the installer's instructions. Don't create a desktop shortcut when asked, and choose to **run Shaxpir** when asked. Not running Shaxpir from the installer may cause Shaxpir to crash when you open it in the future (You may close Shaxpir after it successfully opens for the first time.)

## Contributions
Contributions are likely unnecessary, but should the installer point to an outdated exe feel free to submit a pr or open an issue.
